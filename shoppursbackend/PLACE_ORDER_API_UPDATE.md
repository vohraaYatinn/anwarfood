# Place Order API - CREATED_BY Field Update

## üîÑ **Change Made**

### **API Endpoint**
```
POST /api/employee/place-order
```

### **What Was Updated**
Added `CREATED_BY` field to the `orders` table when placing orders on behalf of retailers/customers.

---

## üìù **Implementation Details**

### **Database Field Added**
- **Field**: `CREATED_BY` in `orders` table
- **Value**: `USER_ID` of the logged-in employee (from JWT token)
- **Purpose**: Track which employee placed the order

### **Code Changes**
```sql
-- Before
INSERT INTO orders (
  ORDER_NUMBER, USER_ID, ORDER_TOTAL, ORDER_STATUS, 
  DELIVERY_ADDRESS, DELIVERY_CITY, DELIVERY_STATE, 
  DELIVERY_COUNTRY, DELIVERY_PINCODE, DELIVERY_LANDMARK,
  PAYMENT_METHOD, ORDER_NOTES
) VALUES (?, ?, ?, 'pending', ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)

-- After  
INSERT INTO orders (
  ORDER_NUMBER, USER_ID, ORDER_TOTAL, ORDER_STATUS, 
  DELIVERY_ADDRESS, DELIVERY_CITY, DELIVERY_STATE, 
  DELIVERY_COUNTRY, DELIVERY_PINCODE, DELIVERY_LANDMARK,
  PAYMENT_METHOD, ORDER_NOTES, CREATED_BY
) VALUES (?, ?, ?, 'pending', ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
```

### **Value Source**
```javascript
const employeeUserId = req.user.USER_ID; // From JWT token
// ...
CREATED_BY: employeeUserId // Employee's USER_ID who placed the order
```

---

## üéØ **Business Logic**

### **Data Flow**
1. **Employee Login** ‚Üí JWT contains `USER_ID`
2. **Place Order** ‚Üí `USER_ID` goes to `orders.USER_ID` (customer/retailer)
3. **Track Creator** ‚Üí `USER_ID` goes to `orders.CREATED_BY` (employee who placed)

### **Database Relationships**
```
orders table:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ USER_ID ‚Üí Points to customer/retailer (who the order is for)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CREATED_BY ‚Üí Points to employee (who placed the order)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ This allows tracking both customer and employee
```

## üìä **Use Cases**

### **For Management**
- **Employee Performance**: Track which employees are placing most orders
- **Sales Attribution**: Credit sales to the correct employee
- **Audit Trail**: Know who placed each order for accountability
- **Commission Calculation**: Calculate employee commissions based on orders placed

### **For Reporting**
- **Employee Sales Reports**: Orders placed by each employee
- **Customer Service**: Know which employee to contact for order issues
- **Performance Analytics**: Track employee productivity
- **Data Integrity**: Maintain complete audit trail

## ‚úÖ **Testing**

### **Verification**
1. **Employee Login** ‚Üí Get JWT token
2. **Place Order** ‚Üí Use `/api/employee/place-order` endpoint
3. **Check Database** ‚Üí Verify `CREATED_BY` field contains employee's `USER_ID`

### **Sample Order Record**
```json
{
  "ORDER_ID": 123,
  "ORDER_NUMBER": "EMP-ORD-1702481234567",
  "USER_ID": 456,        // Customer/Retailer ID
  "CREATED_BY": 789,     // Employee ID (NEW FIELD)
  "ORDER_TOTAL": 1250.50,
  "ORDER_STATUS": "pending",
  "PAYMENT_METHOD": "cod",
  "ORDER_NOTES": "Order placed by employee on behalf of retailer/customer"
}
```
