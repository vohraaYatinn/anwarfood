## üìä **Testing Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: View Recent DWR Records**
```bash
# Request
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/admin/employee-dwr-details/123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Expected: DWR records from last 14 days with station names
```

### **Scenario 2: Filter by Recent Date**
```bash
# Request (using yesterday's date)
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/admin/employee-dwr-details/123?date=2023-12-13" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Expected: Only DWR records for December 13, 2023 (if within 14 days)
```

### **Scenario 3: Try Old Date (Should Fail)**
```bash
# Request (using date older than 14 days)
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/admin/employee-dwr-details/123?date=2023-11-01" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Expected: 400 error - Date filter is limited to last 14 days only
```

### **Scenario 4: Pagination with 14-Day Limit**
```bash
# Request
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/admin/employee-dwr-details/123?page=2&limit=5" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Expected: Records 6-10 from last 14 days only
```

### **Scenario 5: Invalid Employee ID**
```bash
# Request
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/admin/employee-dwr-details/999" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Expected: 404 error - Employee not found
```

## üìã **Database Query Details**

### **Main Query with Station Names**
```sql
SELECT 
  d.DWR_ID, d.DWR_EMP_ID, d.DWR_NO, d.DWR_DATE, d.DWR_STATUS, d.DWR_EXPENSES,
  d.DWR_START_STA, d.DWR_END_STA, d.DWR_START_LOC, d.DWR_END_LOC, 
  d.DWR_REMARKS, d.DWR_SUBMIT, d.DEL_STATUS, d.LAST_USER, d.TIME_STAMP,
  DATE(d.DWR_DATE) as work_date,
  TIME(d.DWR_SUBMIT) as start_time_only,
  TIME(d.TIME_STAMP) as end_time_only,
  start_sta.STA_NAME as start_station_name,
  end_sta.STA_NAME as end_station_name
FROM dwr_detail d
LEFT JOIN sta_master start_sta ON d.DWR_START_STA = start_sta.STA_ID AND start_sta.DEL_STATUS = 0
LEFT JOIN sta_master end_sta ON d.DWR_END_STA = end_sta.STA_ID AND end_sta.DEL_STATUS = 0
WHERE d.DWR_EMP_ID = ? AND d.DEL_STATUS = 0
AND d.DWR_DATE >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 14 DAY)
ORDER BY d.DWR_DATE DESC, d.DWR_ID DESC
```

### **14-Day Filter Logic**
```sql
-- Always applied: Last 14 days only
AND DWR_DATE >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 14 DAY)

-- If specific date requested, both conditions apply
AND DATE(DWR_DATE) = ? 
AND DWR_DATE >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 14 DAY)
```

## üí° **Advanced Features**

### **Automatic Calculations (14-Day Window):**
- ‚úÖ **Work Duration**: Calculates time between start and end
- ‚úÖ **Completion Rate**: Percentage of completed vs draft DWRs (last 14 days)
- ‚úÖ **Expense Totals**: Sum of all expense claims (last 14 days)
- ‚úÖ **Date Range**: First and last work dates (within 14-day window)

### **Station Name Resolution:**
- ‚úÖ **Automatic Lookup**: Resolves station IDs to readable names
- ‚úÖ **Fallback Handling**: Shows "Station not found" for invalid IDs
- ‚úÖ **Active Stations Only**: Only includes active stations (DEL_STATUS = 0)

### **Smart Filtering:**
- ‚úÖ **14-Day Limitation**: Automatically limits all data to last 14 days
- ‚úÖ **Date Validation**: Prevents queries for dates older than 14 days
- ‚úÖ **Pagination Support**: Handle large datasets efficiently within 14-day window

### **Data Enrichment:**
- ‚úÖ **Time Extraction**: Separate time from full timestamps
- ‚úÖ **Status Indicators**: Boolean flags for completion
- ‚úÖ **Station Information**: Both ID and name for reference
- ‚úÖ **Formatted Output**: User-friendly data structure

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

### **Data Limitations:**
1. **14-Day Window**: No data older than 14 days will be returned
2. **Date Filter Restriction**: Date parameter must be within last 14 days
3. **Summary Statistics**: All calculations are based on 14-day window only
4. **Pagination**: Pagination applies only to records within 14-day limit

### **Station Master Integration:**
1. **Foreign Key Relationship**: DWR_START_STA and DWR_END_STA reference sta_master.STA_ID
2. **Active Stations Only**: Only stations with DEL_STATUS = 0 are included
3. **Graceful Handling**: Invalid station IDs show "Station not found"
4. **Both ID and Name**: Response includes both station_id and station_name

## ‚úÖ **Status: PRODUCTION READY**

### **Implementation Complete:**
- ‚úÖ **API Endpoint**: GET /api/admin/employee-dwr-details/:userId

- ‚úÖ **Summary Statistics**: Comprehensive analytics (14-day window)
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: All edge cases covered including date validation
- ‚úÖ **Security Features**: Role-based access control

### **Database Operations:**
